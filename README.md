# Data Science Project Portfolio

This repository showcases a collection of 20+ data science projects developed using Python. The projects are structured to demonstrate a strong understanding of data analysis, machine learning, and visualization techniques across various domains.

## About the Projects

Each folder in this repository represents a separate project or task, focused on one or more of the following:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Data Visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Machine Learning Algorithms (Classification, Regression, Clustering)
- Model Evaluation and Tuning
- Python libraries such as pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn

## Technologies and Tools Used

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Folder Structure

Projects are organized in separate folders. Each folder contains:
- The problem statement or objective
- Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks
- Visualizations and analysis
- Results and observations

## Purpose

This portfolio is intended to reflect practical data science skills through self-driven projects. It highlights capabilities in problem-solving, analytical thinking, and end-to-end model development.
